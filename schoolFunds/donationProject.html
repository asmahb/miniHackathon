        <p>One huge problem we have in public schools is the lack of resources. The books are outdated, the furniture is old, and supplies needed in classrooms are not always available. A solution to this is a website where people can donate items needed specifically for schools. Public schools can register their school on the website, and explain what they need to make their school a better environment for their students. Donors can then access this information and donate to whichever school they would like.</p>
        <p>I have attended public school since 2009, with the exception of the 2018-2018 school year, which was a charter school. Attending this charter school I instantly noticed many differences. Even though both public and charter schools are funded through the state school aid, there was a noticeable difference in the resources received. In the charter school I attended, there were laptops or computers in every single classroom, whereas in the public schools I have attended, computers and laptops have to be shared around the entire school. I have been in classrooms where there are way too many broken desks and chairs . Other students have told me stories about having to run to their next class to ensure they get a seat in class. I have been in classes where the books I am learning from have been taught to students decades before me.</p>
        <p>Public schools not having the dated resources and materials is a problem that has gone on for way too long. How do they expect for students to learn and be at their best when they aren’t even given good enough materials? How can someone expect for a student to be focused on their education when they walk into a classroom and can’t even get access to a desk and chair? Yes money is being funded to these schools but they need way more help. Students should be able to learn in a comfortable environment. According to Linkedin user and educationist Geeta Verma, being in a positive learning environment reduces anxiety, and helps improve attention. She also states that being in a positive learning environment motivates students.</p>
