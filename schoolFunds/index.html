        <p>With all that to say, this is where “Public 2.0” comes in. Public 2.0 is a website where a public school can register to become a school where donations can be sent to them. When they click the button to register, it’ll be asked what is the name of their school, and what state it is located in. It will then ask for your name, your position at the school, and what your classroom needs, and a picture of how the classroom looks. For donors, when they click the donate button, they will be asked for their name, address, which school they are looking to contribute to, and what they will be donating.</p>
        <p>An important thing to note is that donors can donate as they would like, they don’t only have to give out money. The world is evolving, and so should schools. If desks in classrooms are broken, they can be swapped out for couches and tables, beanbags, or even standing desks. Old textbooks can be swapped out for interactive textbooks, and textbooks that are more up to date. If you have footballs in good condition that you don’t happen to use anymore, you could donate that to the gym.  Even if you would like to donate a book to build a library in the classroom, you would be able to do that. Public 2.0’s primary focus and goal is to create an enjoyable space for students so that they are put in a position where they can succeed to their fullest potential.</p>
